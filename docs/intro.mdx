# FaithTech Workbook

## Introduction

Welcome to the FaithTech Workbook! This guide is designed to help you with building technology
using the redemptive framework outlined in the [FaithTech Playbook](https://faithtech.com/wp-content/uploads/The-FaithTech-Playbook.pdf).
Whether you're looking to glorify God by solving real-world problems as part of
a [FaithTech community](https://faithtech.com/communities/), another community of
Christ-followers, or just a couple of friends - this guide is for you!

## Redemptive Technology Design

At [FaithTech](https://faithtech.com/), we believe there is a way of building technology that redemptively changes
the world while transforming those who build it. Our community has developed a uniquely Jesus-centered way to build
that is laid out in the FaithTech Playbook. Check it out by clicking the link below (it's a quick read).

The FaithTech Playbook is part manifesto, part practical. This workbook expands on the practical
aspects that are mapped out in a 4D Cycle.

your understanding and practice.
