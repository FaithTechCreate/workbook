We are thrilled to announce the launch of the FaithTech Workbook, a practical complement to The FaithTech Playbook. This comprehensive guide is designed to equip faith-driven innovators with the tools and knowledge they need to tackle technological challenges through a redemptive lens.

The workbook walks through the 4D Cycle—Discover, Discern, Develop, and Demonstrate—provides a framework for creating technology that honors God and serves others. Our new workbook dives deep into four crucial areas of preparation: sourcing projects, forming teams, setting timelines, and accessing resources for community leaders. Each section offers practical advice, exercises, and reflection questions to help you navigate the complex intersection of faith and technology.

Whether you're a seasoned tech professional or a community leader passionate about leveraging technology for good, this workbook will guide you through the process of initiating impactful projects in your community. We invite you to explore this resource and join us in the exciting journey of developing redemptive technology. Together, we can create solutions that not only solve problems but also reflect the love and wisdom of our Creator.
